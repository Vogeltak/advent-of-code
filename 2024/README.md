# Advent of code, 2023

These are my solutions to the 2023 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

## Usage
```sh
cargo run --release --bin DAY # run a specific day
cargo run --release           # run all days
```

## Acknowledgements
The Rust boilerplate is based on Axel Lindeberg's [2021 entry](https://github.com/AxlLind/AdventOfCode2021).
