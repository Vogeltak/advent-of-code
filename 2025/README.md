# Advent of code, 2025

These are my solutions to the 2025 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

## Usage
```sh
cargo run --release --bin DAY # run a specific day
cargo run --release           # run all days
```

## Acknowledgements
The Rust boilerplate is based on Axel Lindeberg's [setup](https://github.com/AxlLind/AdventOfCode).
